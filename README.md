# toddlers-first-asterisk
A simple asterisk configuration with a single digit dialplans for a toddler to learn how to use an analogue phone

Build with:
```
$ sudo build.sh
```

The build script starts asterisk.

I was unable to get Asterisk to work in a docker container, but it is straight
forward to get it running in an lxd container.
